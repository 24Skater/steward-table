/**
 * Single sign-on.
 *
 * One identity provider across the Steward applications, so somebody who uses
 * Congregation and Table signs in once rather than twice.
 *
 * **Vendored, not imported.** The same file exists in the console, in
 * Congregation and in VBS. That is deliberate: this repository must stay
 * installable by a church that has never heard of the hosted platform, and a
 * shared package would make its `npm install` depend on a registry somebody
 * else controls. When the rule changes, change it in the console and port it
 * here — four small copies anyone can build beat one package only we can
 * install.
 *
 * **It is one more provider, never a replacement.** Google, the emailed link
 * and email-and-password all keep working. With no `AUTH0_ISSUER` the provider
 * is not registered at all and this file changes nothing.
 *
 * **Linking requires a verified email.** An identity provider will happily
 * issue an identity for an unverified address. Linking on one turns "I can
 * claim any email" into "I can take over the account that owns it" — so the
 * verification check is the whole of the security argument for letting an SSO
 * sign-in land on an account that already exists.
