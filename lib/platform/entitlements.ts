/**
 * Entitlement enforcement for this app.
 *
 * Table is AGPL and self-hostable. A church running its own copy has no Steward
 * console to ask, and must not be blocked by one — so when the platform is not
 * configured, every check passes and the app behaves exactly as it did before
 * the platform existed. Enforcement is opt-in by deployment, not by default.
 *
 * When the platform *is* configured, the rules come from the decision record:
 *
 *   ACTIVE / GRACE  full access
 *   READ_ONLY       reads and exports yes, writes no
 *   REVOKED         no access
 *   (absent)        never subscribed to this product
 *
 * Reads survive almost everything on purpose. A church that has lapsed must
 * still be able to log in and export its data, and a console outage must never
 * stop a Sunday — see the fail-open behaviour in ./client.
