/**
 * Verifying calls from the Steward console.

 * Table holds exactly one such secret - its own. A token issued to another
 * product is not accepted here, which is the point of issuing one per app: a
 * leak from VBS cannot provision or read anything in Table.
 *
 * This is deliberately a small local module rather than a shared package. It is
 * twenty lines, it changes approximately never, and depending on a published
 * package to answer "may this request in" would mean a version bump in four
 * repos every time the console's auth changed.
