/**
 * The shape of an entitlement, as the Steward console issues it.
 *
 * This is the *reading* half of the contract and lives here, in this repository,
 * rather than in a package published for four apps to install. Two reasons, and
 * the second is the real one:
 *
 * 1. It is sixty lines that change about once a year. A published package would
 *    mean a version bump in four repositories every time a comment moved.
 * 2. **This repository has to be usable without the platform.** Table is AGPL
 *    and self-hostable, and a dependency that only exists inside Steward's own
 *    registry would make `npm install` fail for anybody who is not Steward.
 *    Code you can only build with permission is not open source.
 *
 * Nothing here is a secret. It describes what a *client* checks, not what the
 * console decides — the issuing, the billing, and the pricing that produce these
 * states are the platform's business and are not in any public repository.
 *
 * Entitlements are keyed by plain product strings rather than by the console's
 * catalogue of product keys. This app only ever asks about itself, and knowing
 * the full catalogue would be knowing something it has no use for.
